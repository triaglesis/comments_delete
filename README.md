# comments_delete

== Delete comments from selected users

This tool will delete any comment which was left by selected user without ban.
Deleting new comments each 30 sec.
Delete old comments in few min after.


You can find some examples, DB scripts and understand the logic.

Latest change is adding user ID from console.

I've stop developing this tool in a middle of new features, so It can looks like nit finished.
Further dev was stopped becase VM was blocked in UA and I see no reason to spend my resources on it.
